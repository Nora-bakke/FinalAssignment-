      <h1>About</h1>
      <h3>We are 7 student who believe in NOT wasting food. We want to make
        booklets/ an app where the user can learn and get the full benefit of
        their food. Some of the information we cover is: what foods last longer
        than others, what parts of a plant you can or canâ€™t eat, easy recipes on
         how to make food of what you already have at home and a lot of other
         tips and solutions!</h3>
      <h2>We can do it!</h2>
      <p>Do you ever have food in the fridge that gets bad before you have time
        to eat it? You're not alone! A study from 2018 shows that the household
        sector accounts for more than half of all food waste in Norway and in
        total 1/3 of all food goes straight into the bin (matvett, 2019). That's
         a sad thought. It is not good for the environment nor is it
         economically appropriate. But do not be discouraged, because the same
         study showed that from 2015 - 2018 we had a decrease of 16,000 tons of
         food waste. This corresponds to a 12% decrease per capita. The food
         industry does its job and we want to help the population contribute
         their share. Therefore, we want to spread knowledge and information
         about how you as individuals can become better at using up the food we
         already have instead of just throwing it away. Because it is possible!</p>
         <h2>The UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h2>
         <p>The UN's number 2 sustainability goal is to eradicate hunger,
           achieve food security and better nutrition, and promote sustainable
           agriculture (UN Sustainability Goal, 2020).<br>
           The UN says that there is enough food for everyone in the world
           today, but due to the skewed distribution we have today, some in the
           world are starving, while others throw away food because they have
           too much. The goal is to be able to distribute the resources more
           fairly and take care of the food in a better way than we do today.<br>
           Sub-goal 2.4 states: "By 2030, ensure that there are sustainable food
            production systems, and introduce robust methods that increase
            productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that
            strengthen the capacity to adapt to climate change, extreme weather,
             droughts, floods and other disasters, and that gradually improves
             the quality of land and soil. "<br><br>
             In Norway, we get more than enough food, and the problem is rather
             unhealthy diet and malnutrition. Luckily, there are plenty of
             healthy, tasty and simple tricks and tips for making both simple
             and advanced meals in a sustainable way. Read our tips on our
             solution page and get inspired.</p>
