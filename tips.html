          <p>Vacuum packing deprives bacteria of oxygen by creating an airtight atmosphere.

            put it in a suitable vacuum bag and when it's done you can store it in the freezer.

            The “best before” dates are about quality, the food is still safe to eat after.</p>

          <h1>Drying Food</h1><br>
          <p>Drying is a good way of preserving food like fruits, vegetables, herbs and meat. Most types of foods can be dried by using an oven, with a dehydrator or in the sun. Drying is also a way for you to save money, not wasting food by worrying so much about the expiration date.
          Dry food can be healthier, especially fruit that has a greater concentration of fiber and antioxidants than fresh fruits.

          <p>It may be easier to keep a track of all your items if you have a system.
            Put the older items that expire soon in the front and the ones that expire in a while at the back.
            This will help you see the items you should use first when you eiter open your refrigerator, freezer
            or pantry.</p>
